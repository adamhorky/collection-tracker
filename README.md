### Collection Tracker
Is there anybody out there?  
I plan to use this for good things.  
It seems like a good tool.

To do List 

1. Item ID
 -   Manufacturer
 -   Platform
 -   Series Name	
 -   Series Number
 -   Year	of Release
 -   Total Made	
 -   Retail	Price
 -   Name
 -   Version	
 -   Ratio	
 -   Artist	
 -   Box	
 -   Card	
 -   Accessory	
 -   Estimate	
 -   Cost

2. Dependancies
 -   GCC 4.4.x or later
 -   CMake 2.8.7 or higher
 -   Git
 -   GTK+2.x or higher, including headers (libgtk2.0-dev)
 -   pkg-config
 -   Python 2.6 or later and Numpy 1.5 or later with developer packages (python-dev, python-numpy)
 -   ffmpeg or libav development packages: libavcodec-dev, libavformat-dev, libswscale-dev

3. Research installation and use of OpenCV
 - **[Linux Install Tutorial](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)** 
 - **[Getting Started](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)** 

4. Establish html5 based page for Database Entry (MariaDB?)
