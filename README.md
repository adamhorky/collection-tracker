### Collection Tracker
Is there anybody out there?  
I plan to use this for good things.  
It seems like a good tool.

To do List 

1. Hierarcy
2. Dependancies?
3. Establish html5 based page


Potential hierarchy for Toy

Company>Style>Line>Series>Year>Name>Ratio>Artist>Box>Card>Accessory>Retail>Cost>Condition>Estimate

Potential hieracrhy for Comic 

Company>Title>Issue>Retail>Cost>Condition>Estimate

Remember if you are making pizza to put aside **20mins** prep time for the dough 3 hours before *you* want to eat.
